# GearS2GarageDoorControl
This is a Tizen project to allow me to quickly see the status of my Garage door &amp; open / close it directly from my watch.
This is especially useful for me when I go for a run / swim and don't have my phone with me.

While this is a Tizen 2 app, but it uses simple HTML / Javascript & CSS and can easily be converted to a web app if required.
